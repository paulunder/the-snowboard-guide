        <section id="hinttext">
            <h2>What should you buy as a beginner?</h2>
            <p>First of all it is important, that you are sure you wanna start a new sport, which needs a lot effort in
                the beginning. If you are not sure, go and rent your gear and try it. After some renting sessions you
                can be sure you wanna do this and can buy gear without headache.</p>

            <h2>BOOTS</h2>
            <p>Snowboard Boots have some different values that are important for you as a beginner.</p>

            <div class="center">

                <div class="infocards">

                    <div class="infocard card4">
                        <h3>BOOT-Size</h3>
                        <p>Your shoe size should fit, if your toes hit a little bit the front of the boot, then it is
                            ok.<br><br> If it feels a little bit loose, then consider another shoe size or even another
                            lacing
                            system -
                            f.e. BOA.</p>
                    </div>

                    <div class="infocard card5">
                        <h3>BOOT-Flex</h3>
                        <p>The Flex defines how “hard” is your boot. Usually there are 3 Flex classes:<br><br>- SOFT
                            (Flex 1-4)<br>- MID (Flex 4-7)<br>- HARD (Flex 7-10)<br><br>
                            So for beginners most of the time the mid class is recommended, but you should also mention,
                            what you wanna ride after you can handle the snowboard a little bit better.</p>

            <h2>SNOWBOARD</h2>
            <p>Essential is also the Snowboard, here it is even more critical to buy or rent the correct gear to learn
                as fast as possible.</p>
            <p>There are 3 important shape-types for Snowboard Beginners </p>
            <div class="center">
                <ol>
                    <li>Rocker</li>
                    <li>Camber</li>
                    <li>Flat</li>

                    <div class="type">
                        <h3>GEAR GURU's Recommendation for Beginners</h3>
                        <div id="recommended">
                            <h3>Hybrid</h3>
                            <p><br>Maybe you already thought that you can combine all these 3 types - this would
                                also be
                                suggestion for you as a beginner - I would highly recommend to get a 60% Camber and
                                40%
                                Rocker. With such a board you can easily learn snowboarding and have also some fun
                                while
                                riding when you are more experienced.<br><br>This is called All-Mountain Board.</p>
                        </div>
                    </div>
                </div>

                <div class="type-container">
                    <div class="type">
                        <h3>ROCKER</h3>
                        <p>The Rocker is known for best times in deep snow. So if you are or wanna be a free rider,
                            then this is your choice. <br>For Beginners this type of Snowboards is recommended,
                            because
                            you can do some faults while riding but you won't fall as easily as you would do with a
                            Camber. <br><br>Except I have to say a pure Rocker is rarely seen, because it is not
                            easy to
                            handle a Rocker on the slope when you are more experienced and ride fast, that is
                            because you cannot get so much pressure on the edges of the snowboard.</p>

                    <div class="type">
                        <h3>FLAT</h3>
                        <p>The Flat Snowboard is the rarest Construction method of snowboards - it is recommended if
                            you prefer make tricks in the park and hit some rails. <br><br>But the truth is that
                            most of
                            park snowboarders use Rocker or Cambers. So after all I would recommend not to buy it
                            for your beginning sessions on the snowboard.</p>
                    </div>

                <div class="type-container">

                    <div class="type">
                        <h3>CAMBER</h3>
                        <p>The Camber construction method is the most popular one. Because of the construction
                            method here you have more pressure on your edges of your snowboard. This board is
                            perfect for slopes, carving and advanced riders. <br><br>But because you have more
                            pressure on
                            you edges a small fault while snowboarding can lead to an accident and even
                            injuries. <br>After all I just recommend Camber for beginners, when they are willing to
                            fall
                            more often, I always say if you prefer to ride on slopes or you like carving with your
                            snowboard then a pure Camber is for you. If you are a beginner and want to do this stuff
                            after learning snowboarding then maybe this is your choice.</p>
